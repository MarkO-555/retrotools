# How to contribute to Retrotools

## Reporting a bug

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/robcfg/retrotools/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/robcfg/retrotools/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **screenshot** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* **Be patient.** Seriously. This project is maintained in my free time, so it can take long for me to answer any question.

## Submitting patches or code changes

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Please refrain from changing the code formatting or submitting purely cosmetic changes.

## Do you have questions about the source code?

* Feel free to send me an e-mail at robcfg@gmail.com

* As stated earlier, **be patient**.

* Please don't spam me.
